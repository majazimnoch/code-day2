# Expanding Gallery CSS 
## Intro

This is the second project of my 30-day coding challenge. The project includes following tech stuff: html, css.

## Idea 
The goal was to make an expanding gallery using just CSS.

## Breaking down the code

Each image box within the gallery is initially set to a small size with a defined background image. On hover, the width of the image boxes expands to 300px, creating the expanding effect.

Additionally, a heading inside each box becomes visible and moves upward, providing additional information about the image.
